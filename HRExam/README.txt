Tech Debt:
	- Better Factory, currently using switch case. I can be a T object.
	- Status and Error Codes
	- Proper Logging

Next priorities:
	- Factory to use T object
	- Dynamic name for rate, will change to "Monthly Rate" or "Daily Rate" depending on the Employee Type
	- Reference table/list for employee type so that it can be maintained by adding more employee type
	- Separation of Rate and Tax on a different object/table, so that it can be maintained by adding deductions and bonuses
